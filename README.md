ZigZag sampler used to explore the conditional space of a diffusion process. Currently under developmemt.

## Overview
the main function introduced is 


It takes a diffusion Model with its parameters, its initial and final point



### Structures

## Examples

for derivation of the set poisson rates see link to docs

## Developing the ZigZag for a new SDE
it requires the creation of 2 functions and 2 flags


## Tuning the velocities
